    <h1>HTML Cheat Sheet</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML is an acronym for HyperText Markup Language and is the most basic building block on the web and defines the meaning and structure of web content. The term HyperText refers to a link between web pages, either within a single website or between different websites. They are a fundamental part of the Web.. Text between takes that form the structure is referred to as Markup Language. Markup is used to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by “tags,” which consist of the element name surrounded by “<“ and “>”.  The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive, which means it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or any mixture of them. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase. The tags are the brackets and their contents, and they contain elements. Inside the header is where the title of the webpage is located. Headings are usually written in bold wehile paragraghs are not. A line break is specified using the &lt;br&gt; tag and is used as the equivalent of the return key on a keyboard.</p>

    <h2>Elements and tags</h2>
    <p>HTML usually requires an opening and a closing tag, but not all events like hr use closing tags. Putting a single word inside of an element, such as putting content as an element of another element, is called nesting.</p>
    <p>Elements are divided into two categories: block-level elements and inline elements. The former creates the structure of the documents while the latter stylized the contents of a block. In addition, a block element takes up 100% of the available space before and after it. An inline element, on the other hand will only take up as much space as it requires. &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;through&lt;h6&gt;, &lt;form&gt;, &lt;o1&gt;, &lt;u1&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, and so on are the most widely used block-level elements. &lt;img&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;button&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, are inline elements.</p>
    <p>A comment is something that you write which is excluded from the source code and as a result, won't appear on the webpage. You write HTML comments starting with &lt;!-- and ending with --&gt;.</p>
    <p>Values that are part of the HTML specification are case-insensitive, like tag names and attribute names. Strings values that are defined, such as class and id names, and attribute values, are case-sensitive.</p>

    <h2>Attributes</h2>
    <p>Attributes are words that describe an element's properties. They give the browser instructions on how to view or manage them. Attributes can only come after elements abd are akways supplied in the start, or opening tag, and are often property/value pairs or name/value pairs. Double quotation marks should always be used around attribute values.</p>
    <p>In HTML5-based form validation, the novalidate attribute is used in the form tag. Type-based validation (e.g. required) will not work after using novalidate in the form tag.</p>

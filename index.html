    <p>My name is Jordan Langley. I am a student at Bow Valley College and I am taking courses in software development. I am learning coding with the intention of learning how to build apps for computers, but I don't know which apps I want to design yet. My hobbies include watching movies, TV shows and tech videos, as well as going out for walks and getting steps in.</p>
    <p>I have been a student at Bow Valley College since September 2024, and I have taken three software development courses: programming fundamentals, web & internet fundamentals, and math for the computer industry.</p>
